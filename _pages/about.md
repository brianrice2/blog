#### Academic

I'm currently a graduate student at Northwestern University in the [MS in Analytics](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/analytics/) program.

I received my BS from Purdue University in 2018 and studied math, actuarial science, and applied statistics. During my time I also completed an independent study covering dynamical systems and mathematical biology with [Aaron Yip](https://www.math.purdue.edu/~yipn/).

#### Interests

I'm interested in a variety of topics within math, statistics, and computer science: in college I particularly enjoyed group and ring theory and stochastic processes. For 2+ years out of college I worked in consulting, analyzing pension and other post-employment benefit plans. Now I'm back in school and learning about analytics, statistics and software engineering. I'm very interested in the engineering side of ML, like data pipelines (especially streaming), model deployment, and distributed systems.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, cycling, lifting, yoga, cooking, and more.
